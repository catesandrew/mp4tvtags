TODO: Update tvdb_api to latest version.

++++++++++  mp4tvtags v0.5  ++++++++++
works on Mac OS X Leopard & Snow Leopard

thanks goes to:
the MP4v2 team (http://code.google.com/p/mp4v2/) for their excellent mp4 container editing library
the Subler team (http://code.google.com/p/subler/), their project was used as a template for MP4Tagger (source code soon to be released)
dbr - http://github.com/dbr/ - for the API wrapper to thetvdb

To actually embed the information in the files, a commandline tagger called MP4Tagger is used. This is a tool based upon Subler, which uses the mp4v2 library. It's written in a mix of C, C++ and Objective-C. Source code will be released.

This requires Python and a compiled version of MP4Tagger which must be placed in the same directory as the the mp4tvtags files.

Usage:
Browse to the folder that contain the tv episodes. Must be in the structure:
Show Name - S[S#]E[E#] <anything> .mp4
example: The X-Files - S01E01 - Pilot.mp4

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b, --batch           selects first search result, requires no human
                        intervention once launched
  -i, --interactive     interactivly select correct show from search results
                        [default]
  -c, --cautious        Writes everything to new files. Nothing is deleted
                        (will make a mess!)
  -d, --debug           shows all debugging info
  -v, --verbose         Will provide some feedback [default]
  -q, --quiet           For ninja-like processing
  -f, --force-tagging   Tags all valid files, even previously tagged ones
  -r, --remove-artwork  removes previously embeded artwork
  -n, --no-renaming     disables renaming
  -t, --no-tagging      disables tagging
  -x FILEEXTENSIONS, --file-ext=FILEEXTENSIONS
                        tells program to only parse inputted extensions.
                        Example: "-x m4v,mp4" (comma seperated list of
                        extensions)
